Data Set Information:

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature.
Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day.
(See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each,
where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from
the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.


Attribute Information:

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. class:
-- Iris Setosa
-- Iris Versicolour
-- Iris Virginica
